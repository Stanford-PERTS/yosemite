<p class="title">Studentsâ€™ PATHS+ Session Instructions</p>
<p class="title">[[ cohort.name ]]</p>
<br>

<p class="letter-greeting">Dear Teachers,</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your school&rsquo;s work in the fall to help implement PATHS+.
    For the final portion of the program this year, your 9th grade students will
    again complete an online survey about academic motivation, self-esteem and
    social anxiety. The step-by-step instructions you will need to introduce and
    facilitate this program are included in this document. Please take a few
    minutes to review these instructions and have them with you when your
    class(es) are scheduled to participate. We have also included some helpful
    tips regarding troubleshooting and FAQs, so you know what to do if any
    issues or questions come up while your students are participating.
</p>
<p>
    Because high classroom and student completion rates are important to the
    goals of this study, students who do not participate on the day the
    sessions are planned will be asked to attend a make-up session. Please use
    the attached &ldquo;Student Make-Up List&rdquo; to indicate which students
    did not participate and the reason why. Instructions are included on that
    form.
</p>
<p>
    Please follow the instructions below. The survey will take approximately
    30-40 minutes to complete.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p class="important-body">
    All participating students should have an Internet-connected device to
    complete the survey, and only one student should be using each device.
    Any students who do not have parental permission to participate should be
    provided with an alternate activity while the rest of the class goes
    through the survey.
</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p class="important-body">Read the following instructions to the class.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Our school is participating in a survey developed by the
        University of Texas at Austin. Today, our class will complete an online
        survey that may help teachers and administrators at our own school and
        researchers better understand how to make school a better place for all
        students. The survey questions are designed to help us understand more
        about the way you, as high school students, think and learn and how you
        feel in regards to academic motivation, self-esteem and social anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Participating in this survey is voluntary and your grade in this
        class will not be affected whether you complete the survey or not. You
        may skip any question or survey you do not wish to answer or complete.
        When responding, choose the answer that best fits what you know or feel.
        Don&rsquo;t pick a response just because you think that&rsquo;s what
        someone wants you to say. Only a limited number of students are
        participating in this survey, and the answers you give are very
        important so the results are useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;I would like to emphasize that this is not a test of you or this
        school. Remember: we will use what we learn to improve students&rsquo;
        experience here and at other schools as well. So please read the
        instructions carefully and do your best to answer all of the questions
        to the best of your ability. If participating in today&rsquo;s activity
        raises any questions or concerns for you, please contact Mr./Ms.
        _____________ at the school.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Finally, it is <strong>very important</strong> that you
        not talk to each other or look at each other&rsquo;s screens. That
        would be a violation of privacy, and I cannot allow it. No one at our
        school will look at your specific answers.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get started in just a moment. When you finish, please
        remain quiet so others can finish too.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p class="important-body">Pause here to answer any questions.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    Write the website address and the code phrase on the board where all your
    students can see it. Distribute the student sign-in cards
    that were prepared for you by your School Coordinator.
    If any student does not have a sign-in card (e.g., new student), they can
    still participate. Instruct them to go to the URL, enter the code phrase,
    and then select this class from the drop down menu. They should then follow
    the instructions on the screen.
</p>
<p class="important-body">
    Read the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Now open your browser and please go to
        <b>studentspaths.org/go</b>. Enter the phrase &lsquo;<strong>[[
        cohort.code ]] 1</strong>&rsquo; and follow the on-screen
        instructions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Please be aware that as you move through the survey, you may
        <strong>not</strong> go back to a previous question. The browser&rsquo;s
        back button won&rsquo;t work during the survey. This protects your
        privacy by never displaying your previous answers to anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Use the drop down menu and select the class shown on the sign in
        card I just gave you. Then, enter your full first and last names in the
        appropriate boxes as shown on your card. If you have a nickname you
        prefer to use, you can enter it, but you must also enter your first and
        last name.
    </p>

    <p>&ldquo;Please begin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    As the students are completing the survey, please complete the <em>Student
    Make-Up List</em> to indicate which students on your roster are
    <strong>not</strong> participating and the reason why not. Return this form
    to your School Coordinator at the end of the survey, or no later than the
    end of the school day.
</p>

<p class="important-body">
    Write on the board the name and contact information of the school counselor
    or another school mental health professional to whom students with questions
    can be referred.
</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    At the end of the class period, ask your students to log out by closing
    their browser window.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;We have reached the end of the survey. It&rsquo;s okay if you are
        not totally done with the survey, just close the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you. The information you have provided may be used to
        improve students&rsquo; experience here and at other schools as well. If
        participating in today&rsquo;s activity raises any questions or concerns
        for you, please contact Mr./Ms. _____________ listed on the board.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
        &ldquo;If you have any questions related to your participation in this
        study, please contact Stephanie Richelsen, Project Manager, at ICF,
        toll-free at 1-844-225-6089.&rdquo;
    </p>
    -->

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="troubleshooting"></a>
<p>
    We work hard to minimize technical problems, but sometimes issues come
    up. Here are some problems students have experienced in the past and the
    best ways to solve them.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    If there is a time-sensitive problem that you need assistance with, please
    call <b>1-844-225-6089</b>. For all school-related issues please contact
    your schoolâ€™s Study Coordinator.
</p>
-->
<p>
    For all school-related issues please contact your schoolâ€™s Study
    Coordinator.
</p>

<h3>Closed Page</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student closed the browser window.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Tell the student to go to
    <a href="https://www.studentspaths.org/go">studentspaths.org/go</a> and
    sign in again, just like they did the first time. The survey will continue
    where the student left off.
</p>

<h3>Warning Message or Connection Expired Message</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student&rsquo;s screen says that the connection
    expired or a similar warning.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Click the &ldquo;reload&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; button.
</p>

<h3>Stuck on a page</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student can&rsquo;t get past a certain page in
    the survey.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Hold down the control key
    (labeled "Ctrl" or "control") and press the y key. This will advance the
    survey to the next
    page.
</p>

<h3>Lost Location</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: The survey restarted from the beginning.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Tell the student to skip up to the part where
    they left off (don't worry; the answers the student previously provided
    have been saved).
</p>

<h3>Student receives the message "You have already taken this survey" or similar</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: The student is given a message with a reason why
    they cannot access they survey.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: There are many reasons this might happen. Most of
    the time the message is correct, e.g. the student already took this or a
    later survey. However, if you and the student determine that the message is
    incorrect and they should still participate, the student can sign in again
    under a different name. For example, &ldquo;Mindy Patel&rdquo; could instead
    sign in as &ldquo;Mindy Patel-Different&rdquo;. When the computer asks if
    the student is really &ldquo;Mindy Patel&rdquo; select &ldquo;None of the
    above&rdquo; and then the student will be able to access the survey. The new
    name can later be linked with the student&rsquo;s correct account.
</p>

<h3>Cannot Connect to studentspaths.org/go</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: Students cannot access the sign-in page when they
    go to studentspaths.org/go.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Check if they can access another website, like
    google.com.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If not, there is a problem with your Internet connection. Talk to
        technical support staff at your school to resolve the issue.
    </li>
    <!--
    <li>
        If you can connect to google.com but you cannot connect to
        studentspaths.org/go, wait for a few minutes and try again. If the
        connection still does not work, call 1-844-225-6089 to speak with a
        study researcher. If you do not reach someone immediately, please leave
        a message and someone will call you back promptly.
    </li>
    -->
</ul>

<h3>A Student Completed the Study in Another Class</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student tells you they have already completed
    the survey in another class.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: The student should NOT do the same session of
    the study more than once. Ask the student to work on something else quietly
    or you may let them leave quietly.
</p>

<h3>Some Students Ran Out of Time</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: Some students do not complete the survey.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: That is fine. Just ask them to get as much done
    as possible. They may be asked to try to complete the session on a later
    date.
</p>

<h2>Answers to Student Questions</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="student_questions"></a>
<ul class="student_questions">
    <li>
        <strong>Do I have to do this?</strong><br>
        Your opinions are important, so I hope that you would at least
        try.<br>
        <em>If a student refuses again, just accept this. You should add them
        to the Student Make-Up List as &ldquo;student refusal,&rdquo; as they
        may change their mind and be interested in participating at a later
        date.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why should I do this?</strong><br>
        Because all of my students are doing this today, and we will learn
        important information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Will I get a grade on this?</strong><br>
        It&rsquo;s not graded. But, when you provide honest answers, it will
        help faculty to do a better job teaching students like you in the
        future.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why do I have different questions from him/her?</strong><br>
        Different students are doing different activities. The survey has a lot
        of different activities, but there&rsquo;s not enough time for everyone
        to do all of them. You should do the ones you were assigned.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Does spelling and grammar matter?</strong><br>
        No, just concentrate on getting your ideas across.
    </li>
</ul>
