                <p>
                    In this course, you will learn practical, research-based advice to help you cultivate a <i>growth mindset</i> in your students. The goal is to help your students stay motivated in the face of challenging work, like that required by the new Common Core. This course consists of five units, and each is presented in a separate session.

                <p>
                    The Common Core standards push students to work on longer and more challenging problems&mdash;ones that require high degrees of persistence. This means that students may encounter more setbacks and more struggle than they are accustomed to.

                <p>
                    As we discussed, students will have to be far more persistent to succeed under the Common Core. A large body of research demonstrates that students with a growth mindset are better placed to succeed when learning is tough. What is a growth mindset?

                <p>
                    In a seminal study, Professor Carol Dweck and her colleagues taught middle school math students a growth mindset through a workshop about the brain. These students became more motivated and earned higher grades than students in a control group who just learned study skills. We'll be hearing more from Carol Dweck later in this course.

                    High school students and college students show the same basic pattern. So there is now compelling evidence that learning how intelligence can grow can help all people learn in more adaptive ways, especially when material is challenging as in the Common Core.

                    Recent neuroscience findings show that the brain is much more capable of change than we previously thought. The outside layer of the brain, called the cortex, is made up of billions of nerve cells called neurons. When people learn new things, the connections between their neurons multiply and strengthen. When individuals engage in effortful practice, stronger connections get made and things that once seemed hard or impossible, like doing calculus or writing well, become easier. Over time, making many such connections results in a stronger, smarter brain.

                    The video presents remarkable examples of neuroplasticity, such as recovering functions after removing half of the brain or learning the street system of one of the world's most complex cities. Neuroplasticity can occur across all students, in all classrooms.  Contrary to the idea that people are born smart, average, or dumb and stay that way for life, research shows that all of us (from babies to adults) can get stronger and smarter as we learn and exercise our brains.

                    Scientists noticed striking differences in the brains of rats who were raised in stimulating and challenging environments compared to those who were raised in sparse and isolated environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a challenging environment, the animals were constantly active, exercising their brains by exploring toys and developing relationships with other animals. But animals who were isolated spent their time just eating and sleeping. The active rats grew more neuronal connections. Compared to the inactive rats, the active rats became better at solving problems and learning new things.

                <p>
                    The same applies in the classroom. Cultivating a challenging atmosphere in a classroom encourages students to build skills that allow their brains to grow.

                    Every student comes into the classroom with different skills based on their past learning. Some students may have never encountered geometry, while others may have spent the summer practicing geometry problems. It can be hard to convince students that they can improve their abilities, especially for students who notice that others are learning more quickly than they are. These students can benefit from being reminded that everyone comes into the classroom with different past experiences. Students may start out in different places, but they can all grow their abilities when their environment:

                <h2>Mindset Messages</h2>
                <p>
                    How can we build a classroom environment that fosters a growth mindset? A first step is to be aware of the messages we send to students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means we need to carefully examine our own beliefs and mindsets. Everyone has fixed mindset thoughts sometimes, even people with a growth mindset. For example, a person who has a growth mindset about history might have a fixed mindset about math. Or an educator might believe that a student is talented in art but can't do math. Or that some students can get smarter, but others cannot. It is important to remember that teachers can transmit these messages to their students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stanford Psychology Professor Carol Dweck explains how we can start understanding and responding to our fixed mindset thoughts.

                <h3>Make Struggle a Good Thing in Your Class</h3>
                <p>
                    Students look up to their teachers. One way you can help your students develop a growth mindset is by sharing a story of when it took you time to master something.  If you once struggled with math and yet are now teaching math, how did you get better at it? Recall how you felt during the struggle; think about what useful strategies you practiced to learn math, and share these with your students.
                </p>
                <h3>Praise the Process: Effort, Strategies, Progress</h3>
                <p>
                    Another way you can promote a growth mindset is through how you praise. When a child takes on a hard problem and makes progress, compliment their effort, their strategies, or their progress. Do not praise children's abilities or tell them &quot;You're smart&quot;—it puts them in a fixed mindset, and makes them afraid of challenge.

                <h2>Mindset Messages: Encouraging Students</h2>
                <p>
                   Here's another way to help your students develop a growth mindset. Before a student attempts a new problem, you can give them growth mindset encouragement. Tell them how the problem can help them get smarter in math or grow their math brain.

                <p>
                    It can be challenging to help students develop a growth mindset. Students will not adopt a growth mindset right away; it is a <u>process</u>. Try guiding students towards it little by little. For example, if a student perceives just one hard problem as an opportunity to grow, that's a good start.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Put another way, have a growth mindset about instilling a growth mindset! It will surely take time and effort, but it gets easier, and it pays off with more motivated and more interested students.

                    Many teachers don't know about the importance of a growth mindset. They think it's helpful to tell kids they are smart or to encourage them to "just do their best". Some teachers even tell their students, "it's okay, you're just not a math person."

                <p>
                    Everyone falls into fixed-mindset thinking sometimes. The first step toward creating a growth mindset culture in our classrooms is to become aware of language that signals one mindset or the other. When you hear or provide praise, ask yourself &quot;What is being praised?&quot; Is it effort, strategy, persistence, focus, and improvement, or does it sound more like a fixed trait or ability? You may be surprised at what you hear.

                <p>
                    Over the next week, pay attention to the language you and your students use in the classroom. Keep a pad of paper handy throughout the day. When something you or your students say or do signals a fixed or a growth mindset, write it down! You may be surprised how often mindset statements come up! Writing them down will help you keep track of how often different types of messages are communicated, and it will help you share your observations with other teachers during the next session. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some questions to think about as you observe mindset statements in your classroom:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How often did you notice and praise effort, strategies, and progress, etc.?</li>
                    <li>What thoughts did you have when a student struggled? Were they growth or fixed mindset thoughts? How could you frame their struggle in a growth mindset way by helping them understand that this is when their brain is growing most?</li>
                    <li>What thoughts did you have when a student excelled? How could you frame their success in a growth mindset way, e.g., by talking about the process that went into their success?</li>
                    <li>What kinds of fixed and growth-mindset statements did your students make?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Remember: please <u>save your notes</u> because we'll ask you to share what you wrote down at the beginning of next session.

                <h2>Activity 2: Helping your students adopt a growth mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    We've discussed how to establish a growth mindset culture.  The goal of this activity is to take these ideas to teach one lesson that exemplifies a growth mindset for your students.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to change students' views about their ability to learn. We encourage you to try something new. Be creative and explore ways to help students see obstacles as opportunities to grow their abilities. Here are some starter ideas from teachers we have worked with in the past. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have students write about something that was hard for them at first but that they eventually learned. Share your own example. Lead a class discussion about how you can grow your brain when you try hard, keep going, and choose challenging problems.</li>
                        <li>Explain that it's through struggle, mistakes, and trying new strategies that people learn and their brains grows. Give a personal example!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Warning! Think about your students' perspective.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes well-intentioned plans to convey a growth mindset can undermine the core message. Do you think the two statements below would help develop a growth mindset in students?  
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whenever students get something wrong, I'll tell them, &ldquo;Try harder and you'll get it&rdquo;.</li>
                    <li>Teach them about growth mindset and fixed mindset, and tell them they should have a growth mindset.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first asks students to put in more effort, but it does not help them understand how to do it or why effort itself is important. In fact, many kids believe that if you're good at something you shouldn't need effort. They believe that effort is evidence that they're not smart. Instead, students need to understand that trying hard on a difficult problem is what grows their brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second statement falls prey to a common trap: telling adolescents what to do is a sure way to get them to do something else. Simply telling students to adopt a growth mindset because it's good for them is likely to meet resistance. We must explain to students the neurological basis for believing in a growth mindset and create an environment that cultivates these beliefs.

                    This year, we will ask you to complete two short surveys. You have completed the first survey, and the
                    second survey will take place during the time you scheduled for the "Follow up" survey. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you know, we will test additional materials with your colleagues. All participating teachers will have access to the most successful materials after the program evaluation has been completed. Since different teachers are doing different activities, remember that it is important not to discuss this program with your colleagues until the program evaluation has been completed.

                    In this session, we will focus on the importance of <b>mistakes</b> for students' success in school and beyond. The new Common Core standards encourage students to challenge themselves because research shows that students learn more deeply when they have the opportunity to struggle, to make mistakes, and to learn from their mistakes. Challenging schoolwork is critical for students' intellectual development. It pushes students to expand their abilities and gives them the opportunity to practice perseverance and critical thinking&mdash;skills that will ultimately help them succeed in school and beyond. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Yet, as many teachers are well aware, students often shy away from challenging schoolwork or get quickly discouraged by it. In this session, we review research on the importance of challenge and struggle for learning, and we discuss the role that students' mindsets play in how they respond to mistakes and difficulties. We then focus on what teachers can do.

                <h2>Mistakes in math</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new math concept for the first time is like exploring a strange new island.  An explorer might wander around and sometimes have to backtrack. That's how they learn the geography. In the same way, students sometimes need to explore when they learn math. They try things out. Some work. Some don't. Each time, a thoughtful student can ask themselves, "Why did this work? Why didn't that work?" They can start to make sense of it through trial and error. But they can only do so if they are comfortable thinking about their mistakes and learning from them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This willingness to make mistakes and to learn from them is not just important in math class. It is important to success in a number of life domains. In the video below, Professor Boaler talks about modern students' fears of mistakes.

                <h2>Promoting challenges and mistakes</h2>
                <p>
                    When teachers challenge students with difficult assignments, they give them the opportunity to learn more in the present, and they help them develop the capacity to learn more in the future. In the present, challenging problems push students to explore concepts deeply and to make the types of mistakes that help them learn. In the long run, challenging work&mdash;when scaffolded the right way&mdash;helps students become comfortable with mistakes and see them as a natural part of the learning process. Professor Jo Boaler explains the importance of challenging problems and the value of making and learning from mistakes:

                <h2>Responding to mistakes</h2>
                <p>
                    Students learn the most when they do hard work, make mistakes, and learn from these mistakes. Unfortunately, many students feel crushed when they make a mistake. They think it means they are not a “math person” or aren't “smart.” Does that mean teachers should avoid assigning challenging work? No! It means that teachers should create a learning environment in which students feel good about making mistakes&mdash;because they know it's how they learn&mdash;and value this opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recent research has found that the brains of individuals who think they can learn from their mistakes respond differently than the brains of individuals who think intelligence is fixed. Professor Carol Dweck explains one such study:

                    In the study by Moser and colleagues at Michigan State University, students with a growth mindset (who view mistakes as opportunities to learn) had different patterns of brain activation after making mistakes than individuals with a fixed mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students with a growth mindset showed greater brain activity associated with awareness of and processing of mistakes. Importantly, this brain activity was associated with improved future performance, or rebounding from mistakes. In the figure below, warmer colors (red, orange) indicate greater activity than cooler colors (green, blue).

                <p>
                    When we asked teachers to change their lesson plans to ensure that students have the opportunity to make and learn from mistakes, some were initially hesitant to do so.  This is because teachers see their job as helping students and making sure they succeed. We understand that it seems counterintuitive to be pleased when students make mistakes, but these are the most important learning times for students. As Professor Carol Dweck describes in the video below, effortless success should not be celebrated. Instead, we must help students become comfortable being challenged.

                        <li>Getting lots of easy problems right should not be a cause for celebration.</li>
                        <li>"Easy" means that you're not learning as much as you could.</li>
                        <li>Make challenge the new comfort zone.</li>

                <p>
                    We all want our students to feel good in class, but that does not mean we should assign easy work. If students never get accustomed to making mistakes and learning from them, they will avoid hard problems in the future. This type of mistake avoidance has been found to promote cheating and to hinder learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast, students are liberated when they learn to view mistakes with a growth mindset. In a growth mindset, students are comfortable being challenged because they don't feel stupid when they (inevitably) make mistakes. Rather, they view mistakes as an important part of the learning process.

                    It is one thing to believe in the power of mistakes, but how do we get our students to pay attention to their mistakes and learn from them? Simply giving students harder assignments does not encourage learning. We need to teach students how mistakes help us learn.

                    Of course, correct answers can be valuable for learning as well&mdash;especially if students make a point to learn from them. For example, when students answer a problem correctly, a teacher can push them to think more deeply by asking, "Why is this right? Why isn't that right?" The key is active learning.

                    When teachers create a more challenging classroom structure, students may be uncomfortable at first. One way to make students more comfortable with mistakes and challenges is to emphasize the learning process over scores or speed.

                <p>
                    Some teachers track students' progress and use statements such as, &ldquo;Not quite there yet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Getting better,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your hard work paid off!&rdquo; to communicate the importance of the learning process to their students. Remind students that the work is tough on purpose&mdash;so that they have the opportunity to grow their abilities&mdash;and make it clear that mistakes are tools for learning.

                <h2>SESSION TWO ACTIVITIES:</h2>
                <p>
                    Just like last time, we'll ask you to apply the knowledge you learned today by incorporating these ideas in your teaching. To help us improve these activities for future teachers, we will ask you at the beginning of the next session what you tried, how it went, and what you believe could have gone better. Thank you for your time and effort!
                </p>
                <h3>Activity 1: Classroom discussion</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it's important to simply tell students that you love mistakes because that's how students learn. Start the class with a lesson on why you like mistakes and what students can learn from them. Lead a discussion on how students feel about making a mistake and why. Here are a few discussion points to get you started:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do you feel when you make a mistake? Why?</li>
                        <li>How do you think other people see you when you make a mistake?</li>
                        <li>Have you ever discovered something new from making a mistake?</li>
                        <li>Have you ever felt proud of making a mistake?</li>
                        <li>Has a mistake ever made you think more deeply about a problem? (You can start by talking about a non-math or non-academic setting, and how the lessons apply to math.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Activity 2: Favorite mistakes</h3>
                <p>
                    Adapt the "favorite no" activity you watched earlier in this session for your classroom (You can find the activity at <a href="https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/class-warm-up-routine" target="_blank">this link</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go through a set of student work, quizzes, or test papers and look for your 'favorite mistake.' An ideal mistake for this exercise is one that shows some conceptual misunderstanding that a lot of students may learn from and that you can discuss with the class. Explain to your class why it is your favorite, what the class can learn from it, and continue to talk through it with your students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may prefer you make it anonymous so you can build up a mistake-friendly culture in your classroom. After the class is comfortable making mistakes, and understands how much that they can learn from mistakes, you can start asking students to volunteer mistakes that the class can work through.
                </p>
                <h3>Activity 3: Keep those mistakes</h3>
                <p>
                    On the next assignment, ask students not to erase anything, but instead to put any mistakes they make in square brackets.  Tell them that when you see their work, you want to see their whole process, including their mistakes along the way.  For example, say &ldquo;It's much more interesting to see that you've noticed a mistake and corrected it than to see a &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; page with erase marks.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h3>Activity 4: Crumpled reminder</h3>
                <p>
                    Give each student a piece of paper, ask them to crumple it up and throw it at the board with the feelings they have when they make a mistake in math. Get them to retrieve the paper, uncrumple it, and color each line with different colors. Tell your students that these lines represent all the synaptic activity that happens when a mistake is made.  Explain how they can learn from mistakes. Ask them to keep the paper and stick it into a notebook or folder to look at when they make a mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                   This physical reminder prompts students to use mistakes to strengthen their brain every time they open their notebook.

                    In the first session, we focused on the importance of students' mindsets for their long-term academic success. In the second session, we addressed how creating a culture of valuing challenges and mistakes in class can help students learn from mistakes and persevere in school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this session, we'll focus on tasks. We'll discuss how to convey a growth mindset and a love for challenges and mistakes through the tasks that we assign students.

                <p>
                    Students given 20 short answer math questions typically think their role is to get them right&mdash;to perform, rather than to learn. When tasks are opened up to give more space for learning inside them, then students are more likely to see math as about learning.

                <p>
                    Giving challenging tasks, as you may have discovered yourself, is easier said than done.  As Professor Boaler explains, an implicit contract exists between teachers and students that limits how much students are willing to struggle through problems.

                <p>
                    There are dozens of ways teachers can help students welcome struggle as an opportunity to learn.  Below are a few of our favorites:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>If a student asks for step-by-step help, guide the student through the challenge by</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asking them to explain the problem to you, and what step might be missing.</li>
                        <li>Suggesting they draw a visual representation of the problem.</li>
                        <li>Asking them to present what they don't understand to the class, as others are challenged by the same thing.</li>
                        <li>Explaining that it's great they are being challenged and allow them to struggle with the concept for a few minutes before giving them a hint.</li>
                        <li>Asking them what are some possible steps forward and discussing how to work through this challenge together without leading them directly</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we recognize the didactic contract, we can both challenge our students and guide them in the right direction to keep them engaged with hard problems.  On the next pages we'll dive into how to create those challenging tasks that lead to growth and deeper learning.

                <h2>The importance of collaboration</h2>
                <p>
                    Especially in math classes, it can be difficult to ensure deep understanding because students can learn a rule without understanding why that rule makes sense. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you will see in the video on the next page, one way to enhance learning is to ask students to explain and convince the class of their answer. This requires students to think through the problem more deeply—and it can also help the rest of the class see the problem from a different perspective. In this way, teachers can create a culture of working together to make sense of problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the video below, Professor Jo Boaler explains the culture of collaboration that Cathy Humphreys, a middle school teacher, has created in her classroom.  Cathy has co-authored a book with Jo Boaler on Mathematical lesson plans, and is an expert on getting students to "make sense" of mathematical concepts.

                    After a student explains the answer based on the &ldquo;rule&rdquo; that you flip the denominator and numerator, she asks the students, &ldquo;Why does that make sense?&rdquo;

                <p>
                    Once we encourage students to make sense of problems, we can enhance deeper learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, students are asked to answer math questions that have one right answer, rather than questions that foster a deep understanding of a concept. In a growth mindset task, such as that shown in the video below, students can be asked to find patterns and to gain a conceptual understanding prior to a mathemetical understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, Professor Boaler gives one example of a growth mindset task that asks students to visually understand a concept that is difficult at first.

                    There are many ways students can begin to develop an understanding of this problem. This is a "Low-floor/High-ceiling" task. This means there is a "low floor," where all students can access the problem, and a "high ceiling," as some students can represent the quadratic function algebraically. The task can be challenging to students no matter what their prior achievement.

                <p>
                    Think of a topic that you will be teaching in the next week. Develop an open task to teach this topic or concept that encourages persistence and learning.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This website gives a lot of good examples of taking a textbook problem and turning it into a task that encourages deeper understanding and discussion: <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?cat=104" target="_blank">http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?cat=104</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help you get started, here are some questions to think about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are different ways of approaching this problem?  Can it be depicted visually?</li>
                        <li>How can I encourage class discussion so the class can work through a concept as a group and have ideas that feed off each other?</li>
                        <li>Can I think of a question that students can talk about in groups to get them interested in the ideas before they are taught? For example, in a Calculus lesson, a teacher could ask students to think about how you would calculate the volume of a lemon before learning the formal methods of Calculus. <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/static/5byoh2x78atjc5m1fctv.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a unit based on this idea.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you introduce this activity, be sure to frame challenging problems as an opportunity to learn from mistakes. Remind students that they are growing their math brains by challenging themselves. Encourage students to make sense of the concept. When a student suggests an approach, ask students to think why it might or might not work. 
                </p>
                <h3>Activity 2: Upping the challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>Upping the challenge</i> &ndash; the goal of this activity is to help students recognize how they're learning the building blocks for even more challenging problems that surround them in the real world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ask students to generate ways to take a problem they've mastered and make it harder. For instance, students could change the question, "Measure the volume of a rectangular pool" to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>&ldquo;Measure the volume of a hexagonal pool.&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;Measure the volume of a pool that has a sloping floor.&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;How many marshmallows can you fit in this pool?&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;How long would it take to fill up the pool with a hose?&rdquo;</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provide some examples of your own to help students get started (e.g., think about ways to connect or integrate concepts, not simply having students do larger calculations).  Then get students to present their more challenging problems, and attempt to solve the underlying concepts as a class. Depending on your classroom, you may find this activity works best to have students brainstorm individually, and then come together in small groups before sharing with the class.

                <h2>Feedback to promote a growth mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    In most classrooms, students take a test at the end of a unit to see if they have learned the material or not. However, assessments are critical <strong>during</strong> learning&mdash;to shed light on students' learning processes, what they have learned, and what they haven't learned yet.

                    Assessments for learning are &ldquo;check-ins&rdquo; or markers of a student's learning progress. The feedback is primarily descriptive. It emphasizes strengths, identifies challenges, and points to next steps for the student. As teachers track students' understanding of course material, they can adjust their instruction to make sure students keep progressing along their learning paths.

                    As Professor Boaler noted, students' understanding of where they are in their learning path can also come from self and peer assessment.

                <p>
                    Formative assessments can take quite a bit of time and effort. Sometimes it is difficult to provide this feedback on a frequent basis. So self and peer assessments can be a great way for students to assess themselves. Professor Boaler provides a quick example of a self-assessment:

                <h3>Activity 1: Introduce participation "quizzes"</h3>
                <p>
                    In a participation quiz, students work together in small groups on a particular topic. Each group receives a grade for its work as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a wonderful way to increase students' engagement in group work. It turns the focus from getting problems right to learning as a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you start:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Give students a clear idea of <u>what</u> they should be doing mathematically&mdash;what problem or concept they are to work on. <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/static/fbg0uuoygftwvgj4ecgb.pdf">Here</a> is an example of one teacher’s learning goals for students.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Give students a clear idea of <u>how</u> you want them to work in groups. Discuss the criteria for good participation (for which you will hold students accountable), such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Equal participation.</li>
                                <li>Students should think out loud, share ideas, and give each other feedback.</li>
                                <li>Everyone in the group should be able to explain the concept, idea, or answer.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/static/bzsqxzp643xugu9s68o5.pdf">Here</a> is an example of one teacher’s guidelines for group work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students then work in small groups. As they work, walk around and briefly note positive or negative interactions. You can write these down on a private piece of paper, or record them on a board for all students to see. At the end of the lesson give each group a grade. <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/static/jexzcua8x3s3gvk9kmlh.pdf">Here</a> is an example of one teacher’s notes and grades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before trying a participation quiz some teachers worry that it may be hard to keep track of how so many groups are doing, but teachers generally find it manageable, even with 8 or 9 groups. Teachers' notes are typically very brief and help them assign a grade to each group for how well it worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some teachers find that students' group work does not change much in the first quiz but changes greatly after the first or second quiz. Once students receive a grade for how well their group worked together they take group work more seriously. The next time they work harder to make group work equal, that is, to encourage everyone to speak, to look for shared understanding, to help peers who don't yet understand the material, etc. Some teachers find that participation quizzes completely change group work in their classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember to make sure students know exactly what you expect in each group. Hold students accountable for working well together—make sure they participate equally and that each student can explain the concept, idea, or answer to each other or to you. You can hold students accountable by asking one student in each group to explain the concept or answer a question. If the student cannot answer, move on to the next group, as it is the group's responsibility that everyone understand. Tell the student to listen to students in other groups or to work with their own group to learn. Later on, return to groups where students could not answer the question and ask the same student to share what they have learned.

                <h3>Activity 2: Assessment for Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are two assessments for learning: self-assessments and peer assessments. Try one or both!
                </p>

                <p> 1. Self-assessments:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In self-assessments, students evaluate their learning against specific learning goals. Set learning goals for your students in your current unit. Write the learning goals on the board for all to see.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    On a regular basis (e.g., twice a week), ask students to evaluate how well they are progressing toward each learning goal. For instance, students could assess their progress toward the following learning goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I understand how to calculate the mean of a set of numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I understand the difference between mode and median. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I can give an example of when mode, mean, and median would be used.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Students assess themselves against these learning goals on a 3-point scale For example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1&mdash;I don't understand this yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>2&mdash;I have some understanding of this.
                    </li>
                    <li>3&mdash;I fully understand this.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Self-assessments are meant to help both you and the student understand how students are progressing toward learning goals. It is important for students to see their progress. They also serve the purpose of helping students understand what they are meant to be learning, which is an awareness that many students lack and that is key to high achievement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As described below, have your students share their self-assessments with you so you can modify your teaching to best support your students’ learning.
                </p>    

                <p>
                    2. Peer assessments:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like self-assessments, peer assessments rely on specific criteria to assess students’ learning and highlight the important concepts students should be thinking about. Students give feedback on each other’s work based on these criteria. For example, students can assess a peer’s homework or in-class work and give it one or more “stars” and “wishes.” Stars represent what the student has done well. Wishes represent how the student could improve. Have students share their peer assessments with each other and with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Use your students' assessments:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        to adjust your teaching pace or focus as necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to identify and help individual students who have not yet understood a particular concept or idea.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to challenge individual students with new questions or work who have understood a particular concept or idea.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Assessment for learning should be a back-and-forth process: You get feedback from your students about their understanding, which helps you adjust your teaching. Students think about their own understanding, which they share with teachers. They learn:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Where they are in their learning.
                    </li>

                    <li>Where they should be.
                    </li>

                    <li>How they can close the gap between the 2 places.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When teachers and students engage in “assessment for learning,” you can teach more effectively and students learn to take more responsibility for their learning as they become more aware of what they need to learn. Assessment for learning has a substantial research base that shows that it leads to large achievement gains. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It might take a few times for students to get comfortable with self and peer assessments and to use them effectively, so try it 3-5 times.

                <h3>Activity 3: Use inverted tests to teach students a growth mindset</h3>

                <p>
                    Tell students that homework and tests are for learning&mdash;that when you get your work back you should look for mistakes you made so you can grow and learn from them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As practice, give students a test completed by a fictitious student who didn't do very well. Make sure this fictitious student showed his or her work on the problems. Ask your students to correct this fictitious student's test. Students should:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Identify what the fictitious student understood well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Identify mistakes the fictitious student made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explain each mistake, the conceptual idea relevant to each mistake, and how they themselves would approach or solve the problem.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Evaluate students in terms of how many mistakes they identify and how well they explain the mistakes and underlying conceptual ideas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Use this exercise instead of a traditional test – it truly taps students' understanding. Try it 2-3 times to help students get the hang of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remind students that when they get their own tests and homework back they should do the same thing&mdash;look for and learn from mistakes. You can even assign students to do this activity using their own work.

                <h2>Program Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoyed the program. Below is a summary of what we covered. You can also download <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/static/us5u0qcpk7ta6zwe4a7u.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue">this pdf</span></a> to remind yourself of the key points of this program. 
                </p>
                <h3>Session 1:</h3>
                <p>
                    Although neuroscience shows that the brain can change and grow, many students believe that intelligence is a fixed trait. When students hold this "fixed mindset," they give up easily in the face of challenges because they think that effort, mistakes, or difficulty mean they’re not smart. This is troubling for educators, especially with the introduction of the Common Core. The new standards call on educators to challenge students to promote deeper learning. Students who have a “growth mindset,” who believe that intelligence can grow, view challenge as an opportunity to learn. As educators, we can prepare our students to excel in challenging learning environments by fostering a growth mindset.
                </p>
                <h3>Session 2:</h3>
                <p>
                    One way to foster a growth mindset is to help students understand that challenge and mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow their brains. Research shows that students learn the most when they make mistakes and struggle on hard problems. Educators can encourage productive struggle and mistakes by assigning new types of problems, celebrating mistakes rather than perfect scores, explaining to students why mistakes are valuable, and helping students recognize the progress they have made. 
                </p>
                <h3>Session 3:</h3>
                <p>
                     Another way to foster a growth mindset and encourage productive struggle is to assign richer, more open-ended tasks. Typical math problems with one right answer can discourage a growth mindset. Educators can modify tasks in their classrooms by allowing students to come up with problems on their own, encouraging productive struggle instead of quickly telling students the answer, focusing on "sense-making" rather than following set rules to be memorized, and creating a culture of collaboration and problem-solving among students.
                </p>
                <h3>Session 4:</h3>
                <p>
                    Teachers can also encourage a growth mindset by changing how they assess students. Typical assessment practices can inadvertently convey fixed mindset ideas . For example, timed tests can suggest that getting answers quickly is better than fully understanding concepts. Educators can modify tasks by giving formative feedback, using assessments to provide students with a clear sense of their learning paths, shifting the focus from performance to understanding areas for improvement, setting learning goals for students, utilizing self and peer assessment to encourage students to take responsibility for their own learning, and focusing on the work students have done (the process) rather than their ability.
