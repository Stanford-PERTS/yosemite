<p class="title">Students&rsquo; PATHS Study Day Instructions</p>
<p class="title">Instructions for [[ cohort.name ]]</p>
<p class="title">Sessions 1 and 2</p>
<br>

<p class="letter-greeting">Dear Teachers,</p>
<p>
    During the fall semester, your 9th grade students are being given the
    opportunity to participate in a program that uses the latest evidence-based
    methods to positively affect student attitudes about learning. The
    instructions you will need to introduce and facilitate this program are
    attached. Please take a few minutes to review these instructions and bring
    them with you when your class(es) are scheduled to participate. We have
    also included some helpful tips regarding troubleshooting and FAQs, so you
    know what to do if any issues or questions come up while your students are
    participating.
</p>
<p>
    Because high classroom and student completion rates are important to the
    goals of this study, students who do not participate on the day the
    sessions are planned will be asked to attend a make-up session. Please use
    the attached “Student Make-Up List” to indicate which students did not
    participate and the reason why. Instructions are included on that form.
</p>
<p>
    We hope this program is helpful for your students, however, please do not
    discuss this expectation with your students. That is, we would appreciate
    it if you would not emphasize that it might be helpful for them. Instead,
    please emphasize how much the researchers need their input and that their
    opinions are valuable.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, unless you suspect that a student is experiencing difficulty
    and needs support, please do not ask students anything about their
    experience&mdash;whether they liked it, what they thought about it, what
    they wrote about, etc. Also discourage students from sharing information
    about it with their peers. You can say, &ldquo;Let other students
    experience it for themselves.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="letter-closing">
    Thank you for your participation!<br>
    The Students' PATHS Researchers

<h2>Session Instructions</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="session_instructions"></a>

<p>
    Sessions 1 will take about 45 minutes; Session 2 will also take about 45
    minutes. Please follow the instructions below for each session.
</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p class="important-body">
    All participating students should have an Internet-connected computer to
    complete the activity, and only one student should be using each computer.
    Any students who do not have parental permission to participate should be
    provided with an alternate activity while the rest of the class goes
    through the program.
</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p class="important-body">Read the following instructions to the class.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Our school is participating in a program developed by Stanford
        University. Today, our class will participate in the [first or second]
        of two online activities that may help teachers and administrators at
        our own school and researchers at Stanford better understand how to
        make school a better place for all students. The activities are
        designed to help us understand more about the way high school freshman
        think and learn. You’ll be answering survey questions, reading some
        short passages, and answering some questions about what you read.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Participating in this activity is voluntary and your grade in
        this class will not be affected whether your complete the activity or
        not. You may skip any question or activity you do not wish to answer or
        complete. When responding, choose the answer that best fits what you
        know or feel. Don’t pick a response just because you think that’s what
        someone wants you to say. Only a limited number of students are
        participating in this program, and the answers you give are very
        important so the results are useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;I would like to emphasize that this is not a test of you or this
        school. Remember: we will use what we learn to improve
        students'experience here and at other schools as well. So please read
        the instructions carefully and do your best to answer all of the
        questions to the best of your ability.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Finally, it is <strong>very important</strong> that you
        not talk to each other or look at each other's screens. That
        would be a violation of privacy, and I cannot allow it. No one at our
        school will look at your specific answers.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;We’ll get started in just a moment. When you finish, please
        remain quiet so others can finish too.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="important-body">Distribute headphones.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Some sections of the program have audio, so you will need to use
        headphones. Each of you is receiving headphones to listen to these
        segments without disturbing other students. These headphones are yours
        to keep and use for both sessions.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Students can also use their own personal headphones, according to school
    policy, if it’s not disruptive to the class to retrieve them.
</p>
<p class="important-body">Pause here to answer any questions.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    Write the website address and the code phrase where all your students can
    see it. Distribute the student sign-in cards for the appropriate session
    that were prepared for you by your School Coordinator. If any student does
    not have a sign-in card (e.g., new student), they can still participate.
    Instruct them to go to the URL, enter the code phrase, and then select this
    class from the drop down menu. They should then follow the instructions on
    the screen.
</p>
<p class="important-body">
    If this the <strong>first session</strong> with the students, read the
    following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Now open your browser and please go to <b>studentspaths.org/go</b>. Enter the phrase
        &lsquo;<strong>[[ cohort.code ]] 1</strong>&rsquo; and follow the
        on-screen instructions.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="important-body">If this the <strong>second session</strong> with the students, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Now open your browser and please go to <b>studentspaths.org/go</b>. Enter the phrase
        &lsquo;<strong>[[ cohort.code ]] 2</strong>&rsquo; and follow the
        on-screen instructions.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="important-body">
    For both sessions, read the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Please be aware that as you move through the program, you may
        want to go back to a previous question. If so, <strong>do not
        use</strong> the back arrow on the browser. Instead, use the &ldquo;Go
        Back&rdquo; link in the upper left corner, just above the questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        &ldquo;Use the drop down menu and select the class shown on the sign in card I just gave you. Then, enter your full
        first and last names in the appropriate boxes as shown on your card. If you have a nickname
        you prefer to use, you can enter it, but you must also enter your first
        and last name.
    </p>

    <p>&ldquo;Please begin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    As the students are completing the program, please complete the <em>Student
    Make-Up List</em> to indicate which students on your roster are
    <strong>not</strong> participating and the reason why not. Return this form
    to your school coordinator at the end of the session, or no later than the
    end of the school day.
</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    Ten minutes before students need to finish, tell them how much time is
    remaining and that it is okay if they do not have time to finish
    everything.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;We have about ten minutes remaining in the class period. Please
        continue with the activity, but do not rush. It is okay if you do not
        have time to finish everything. You can log back in to the program at a
        later date.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p class="important-body">
    At the end of the class period, ask your students to log out by closing
    their browser window.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        &ldquo;We have reached the end of the session. It's okay if you are not
        totally done with the activity, just close the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you. The information you have provided may be used to
        improve students' experience here and at other schools as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;If you have any questions related to your participation in this
        study, please contact Alice Roberts, Project Director, at ICF
        International, toll-free at 1-844-225-6089.&rdquo;
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="troubleshooting"></a>
<p>
    We work hard to minimize technical problems, but sometimes issues come
    up. Here are some problems students have experienced in the past and the
    best ways to solve them.
</p>
<p>
    If there is a time-sensitive problem that you need assistance with, please
    call <b>1-844-225-6089</b>. For all school-related issues please contact
    your school’s Study Coordinator.
</p>

<h3>Closed Page</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student closed the browser window.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Tell the student to go to
    <a href="//www.studentspaths.org/go">studentspaths.org/go</a> and sign in
    again, just like they did the first time. The program will continue where
    the student left off.
</p>

<h3>Warning Message or Connection Expired Message</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student's screen says that the connection
    expired or a similar warning.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Click the &ldquo;reload&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; button.
</p>

<h3>Stuck on a page</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student can't get past a certain page in the survey.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Hold down the control key (labeled "Ctrl" or
    "control") and press the y key. This will advance the survey to the next
    page.
</p>

<h3>Lost Location</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: The survey restarted from the beginning.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Tell the student to skip up to the part where
    they left off (don't worry; the answers the student previously provided
    have been saved).
</p>

<h3>Student receives the message "You have already taken this survey" or similar</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: The student is given a message with a reason why
    they cannot access they survey.<br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: There are
    many reasons this might happen. Most of the time the message is correct,
    e.g. the student already took this or a later survey. However, if you and
    the student determine that the message is incorrect and they should still
    participate, the student can sign in again under a different name. For
    example, "Mindy Patel" could instead sign in as "Mindy Patel-Different".
    When the computer asks if the student is really "Mindy Patel" select "None
    of the above" and then the student will be able to access the survey. The
    new name can later be linked with the student's correct account.
</p>

<h3>Cannot Connect to studentspaths.org/go</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: Students cannot access the sign-in page when they
    go to studentspaths.org/go.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Check if they can access another website, like
    google.com.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If not, there is a problem with your Internet connection. Talk to
        technical support staff at your school to resolve the issue.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you can connect to google.com but you cannot connect to
        studentspaths.org/go, wait for a few minutes and try again. If the
        connection still does not work, call 1-844-225-6089 to speak with a
        study researcher. If you do not reach someone immediately, please leave
        a message and someone will call you back promptly.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>A Student Completed the Study in Another Class</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: A student tells you they have already completed
    the survey in another class.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: The student should NOT do the same session of
    the study more than once. Ask the student to work on something else quietly
    or you may let them leave quietly.
</p>

<h3>Some Students Ran Out of Time</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: Some students do not complete the survey.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: That is fine. Just ask them to get as much done
    as possible. They may be asked to try to complete the session on a later
    date.
</p>

<h3>Audio Issue</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>: Student cannot hear the sound.</br>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Look for a speaker cone symbol in the upper
    right or lower right corners of the screen for volume controls. Check that
    the computer is not muted, that the volume is turned up high enough, and
    that the headphones are fully plugged in.
</p>

<h2>Answers to Student Questions</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="student_questions"></a>
<ul class="student_questions">
    <li>
        <strong>Do I have to do this?</strong><br>
        Your opinions are important, so I hope that you would at least
        try.<br>
        <em>If a student refuses again, just accept this. You should add them
        to the Student Make-Up List as &ldquo;student refusal,&rdquo; as they
        may change their mind and be interested in participating at a later
        date.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why should I do this?</strong><br>
        Because all of my students are doing this today, and we will learn
        important information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Will I get a grade on this?</strong><br>
        It’s not graded. But, when you provide honest answers, it will help
        faculty to do a better job teaching students like you in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why do I have different questions from him/her?</strong><br>
        Different students are doing different activities. The program has a
        lot of different activities, but there’s not enough time for everyone
        to do all of them. You should do the ones you were assigned.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Does spelling and grammar matter?</strong><br>
        No, just concentrate on getting your ideas across.
    </li>
</ul>
