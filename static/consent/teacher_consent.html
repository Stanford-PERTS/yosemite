DESCRIPTION: <br>
You are invited to participate in a research study. This study explores how different educational activities and views about school affect motivation and academic outcomes. If you choose to participate, you will complete several online activities. In the course of completing these activities, you may practice academic skills like reading or mathematics or answer questions about yourself or others in school. We are interested in how different individuals may benefit from different kinds of activities.

We are also interested in determining if and how the study activities affect people's academic outcomes or those of individuals they interact with in the school setting. By participating in this research, you grant consent to your school to share any academic and/or disciplinary records with our research team for the duration of the study protocol. That information will be kept confidential; it will not be shared with anyone outside the research team in a way that could be used to identify you.
