    <h3>Mindsets Matter</h3>
    <p>	Individuals have different mindsets about learning.
		People who have adaptive mindsets understand why learning is important; 
		they trust their supervisors and peers; and they understand that they can grow their 
		 abilities by working hard and by trying new strategies when they get stuck.
		 These attributes can be critically important for success in school and
		 in the workplace.
	</p>
	<h3>Custom Mindset Programs</h3>
    <p>	All of our programs draw on the latest behavioral research and theory to affect 
		key mindsets. 
		We evaluate the success of our programs by their effects on quantifiable performance metrics. 
		If your organization
		could benefit from our research-grounded approach, we encourage you to review our
		free,
		<a href="../programs">current programs</a>. We may also be able to 
		develop a custom program to fit your needs. See below to learn about custom 
		program requirements.
	</p>
	<h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>
	Limited time and resources mean our team must choose projects that 
	maximize our reach and impact. 
	We can only consider custom program requests that 
	give us the opportunity to 1) measurably affect significant numbers of individuals or 
	2) provide funds to build up our internal capacity. Specifically, organizations 
	that request custom programs must minimally:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Enroll 10,000 or more participants in a randomized controlled trial 
			and provide access to an important real-world outcome that could be used 
			to test the program's effectiveness, for example, participants' 
			academic records, standardized test scores, or 
			work performance.<br><br> Or<br><br></li>
		<li>Sponsor the program with at least $50,000.</li>
	</ol>
