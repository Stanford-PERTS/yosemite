    <h2>A brief, online program designed to raise academic achievement and motivation</h2>
    <br>

    <h3><b>Helping students become resilient learners by changing key beliefs</h3></b>

    <p>This program targets two key academic mindsets: <i>1) Growth Mindset of Intelligence</i> and <i>2) Sense of Purpose.</i></p>
    <p>When students realize they can succeed and why it matters, they try harder and do better in school. This program 1) teaches students that the brain is like a muscle and can become stronger through challenges and effort, and 2) guides students through writing exercises that focus on personally meaningful, pro-social reasons for trying their best in school.</p>

            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Enroll a minimum of 150 9th grade students who will participate.</li>
              <li>Provide us with a FERPA letter of agreement to allow us to share data.</li>
              <li>Designate a school administrator or faculty who will act as the School Coordinator.  This person will be our point of contact throughout your school's participation.</li>
              <li>Teachers use a simple, online form to schedule when their classes will participate in the program. This process takes 5-15 minutes.</li>
              <li>At the scheduled times, teachers take their students to the school computer lab. Instructions for each of the two sessions are provided to teachers when they schedule participation. Participation consists of two 45-minute sessions.</l>
              <li>Provide us with the academic records of participating students at the end of the semester.  We will use these records to analyze the effects of the program.</li>

            <h4>What should I tell my students about this program?</h4>
            <p>It is important not to tell your students that the program is intended to help them (see below). Doing so could prevent the program from working. You can describe the program as a study about how students learn and what schools can do to make school a better place for them. Once you register, you will receive a short document describing how to best introduce the study to your students.</p>
            <h4>Why shouldn't I tell my students this program is meant to help them?</h4>
            <p>People often get defensive when they are told something is meant to help them. They may feel insulted or become unduly skeptical, and this can prevent them from internalizing the program's key messages.</p>
            <h4>What about privacy?</h4>
            <p>We will always respect your privacy and your students' privacy. Our programs are approved by the Stanford University Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. Sensitive data are collected and stored securely, and they are only shared in de-identified or aggregate form with individuals outside the PERTS research team.</p>
