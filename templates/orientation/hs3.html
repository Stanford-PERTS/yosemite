      <h3>Apply to Participate</h3>
      <p>The PERTS Lab at Stanford University is seeking passionate educators to participate in the High School Student Perspectives Program. This 90 minute program is designed to raise the motivation and achievement of high school students. Previous versions have improved students' grades, classroom behavior, and performance on standardized exams -- all by changing students' mindsets about school.</p>

    <h3>How does the Student Perspective Program work?</h3>
    <p>Many students hold beliefs that distract their attention and undermine their motivation. The Student Perspectives Program tries to overturn these beliefs. When it does, it can boost students' motivation and achievement. For example, one component of the program is designed to increase a sense of belonging. Many students experience social setbacks and feelings of isolation when they transition to a new school. Such setbacks can undermine students&rsquo; academic performance, well-being and health. This component works by helping students question the belief, &ldquo;Students like me don&rsquo;t belong at this school.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>A second component teaches students that they can grow their intelligence and abilities through effort. It challenges the belief that "I could never be good at this, no matter how hard I tried." Students work through an online module that explains that intelligence is malleable. When students realize they can increase their intelligence and abilities through effort, they can become more personally invested in their success.</p>

        	<h5>What are requirements for schools?</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Enroll at least 100 9th-12th grade students who will participate.</li>
              <li>Designate a school administrator or faculty who will act as the School Coordinator. This person will be our point of contact throughout the school's participation. The School Coordinator will also provide us with the academic records of participating students at the end of the semester. We will use these records to analyze the effects of the program. We will then send participating teachers and administrators a report summarizing the results.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>What are the requirements for teachers?</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Teachers use a simple, online form to schedule when their classes will participate in the program. This process takes 5-15 minutes.</li>
              <li>At the scheduled times, teachers take their students to the school computer lab. Instructions for each of two sessions are provided to teachers when they schedule participation. Participation takes 45 minutes per session.</li>
            </ol>

        	<h5>What should I tell my students about this program?</h5>
            <p>It is important not to tell your students that the program is intended to help them (see below). Doing so could prevent the program from working. You can describe the program as a study about how students learn and what schools can do to make school a better place for them. Once you register, you will receive a short document describing how to best introduce the study to your students.</p>
            <h5>Why shouldn't I tell my students this program is meant to help them?</h5>
            <p>People often get defensive when they are told something is meant to help them. They may feel insulted or become unduly skeptical, and this can prevent them from internalizing the program's key messages.</p>
            <h5>What about privacy?</h5>
            <p>We will always respect your privacy and your students' privacy. Our programs are approved by the Stanford University Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. Sensitive data are collected and stored securely, and they are only shared in de-identified or aggregate form with individuals outside the PERTS research team.</p>
