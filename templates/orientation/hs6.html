    <h3>Test anxiety can hurt test performance</h3>
    <p>	Many students get anxious during high-stakes tests. 
		Some even get anxious about getting anxious because they think their 
		nervousness might make them 
		choke at a critical moment. Test anxieties can distract 
		students' attention and reduce their test scores.</p>
	<h3>How does this program help?</h3>
    <p>This program helps students think about their text anxiety in a different way.
		It teachers them that nervousness can actually enhance performance if channeled properly.
		When students understand that nervousness is the bodyâ€™s way of preparing for a challenge
		- that the increase in adrenaline can even help them perform better - 
		they are better able to focus on the task at hand.</p>
    <p>Another component of the program uses expressive writing to reduce test anxiety directly. 
		Giving students the opportunity to write about their worries before a high 
		stakes test provides them with the opportunity to reevaluate their concerns. 
		It decreases the need to continue thinking about the possible negative 
		consequences of poor performance and frees otherwise anxious students to 
		focus all of their attention on the exam.</p>
	<h3>What do students experience?</h3>
    <p>Students complete a 30-45 minute online module immediately before a high-stakes
		test or practice test. The module includes survey questions, short reading passages, and targeted writing exercises. 
		Many students report enjoying the experience and finding the activities interesting.</p>

        	<h5>What are requirements for schools?</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Enroll at least 100 students who will participate.</li>
              <li>Designate a school administrator or teacher to act as the 
				  School Coordinator. This person will be our point of contact 
				  throughout the school's participation. The School Coordinator 
				  will also provide us with the academic records of participating
				  students at the end of the semester. We will use these records
				  to assess the effectiveness of the program.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>What are the requirements for teachers?</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Teachers use a simple, online form to schedule when their classes will participate in the program. This process takes 5-15 minutes.</li>
              <li>At the scheduled times, teachers take their students to the school computer lab. Instructions for each of the two sessions are provided to teachers when they schedule participation. Participation takes 30 minutes for the first session and 15 minutes for the optional follow-up session.</li>
            </ol>

        	<h5>What should I tell my students about this program?</h5>
            <p>It is important not to tell your students that the program is intended to help them (see below). Doing so could prevent the program from working. You can describe the program as a study about how students learn and what schools can do to make school a better place for them. Once you register, you will receive a short document describing how to best introduce the study to your students.</p>
            <h5>Why shouldn't I tell my students this program is meant to help them?</h5>
            <p>People often get defensive when they are told something is meant to help them. They may feel insulted or become unduly skeptical, and this can prevent them from internalizing the program's key messages.</p>
            <h5>What about privacy?</h5>
            <p>We will always respect your privacy and your students' privacy. Our programs are approved by the Stanford University Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. Sensitive data are collected and stored securely, and they are only shared in de-identified or aggregate form with individuals outside the PERTS research team.</p>
