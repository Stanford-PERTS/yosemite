    <h2>A brief, online program designed to enhance students' resilience during the transition to middle school</h2>
    <br>

    <h3><b>Middle School: A Period of Transition</h3></b>
    <p>
        Developed to help with the new challenges that arise in middle school, this program targets two key academic mindsets:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><i><b>Growth Mindset of Intelligence:</i></b> When students believe their intelligence can grow through challenge and effort, they try harder and do better in school. This program teaches students that the brain is like a muscle and can become stronger with practice.</li>
            <li><i><b>Growth Mindset of Emotion:</i></b> Students who believe it is possible to change unhelpful emotions are more likely to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies. This program teaches students that they can improve their ability to change their emotions and gives them examples of how to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies.  </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3><b>About the Program</h3></b>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><i><b>Developed by Experts:</i></b> Designed by leading education and motivation researchers</li>
            <li><i><b>Engaging:</i></b> Program includes brief passages of reading, writing exercises, and survey questions. 
            <li><i><b>Simple:</i></b> No training required</li>
             <li><i><b>Brief:</i></b> 105 minutes total</li>
            <li><i><b>Free:</i></b> As part of a randomized controlled trial</li>
        <ul>

            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Enroll a minimum of 150 middle school students (6th-8th grade) who will participate.</li>
              <li>Provide us with a FERPA letter of agreement to allow us to share data.</li>
              <li>Designate a school administrator or faculty who will act as the School Coordinator.  This person will be our point of contact throughout your school's participation.</li>
              <li>Teachers use a simple, online form to schedule when their classes will participate in the program. This process takes 5-15 minutes.</li>
              <li>At the scheduled times, teachers take their students to the school computer lab. Instructions for each of the three sessions are provided to teachers when they schedule participation. Participation takes 45 minutes for the first two sessions and 15 minutes for the follow-up session.</li>
              <li>Provide us with the academic records of participating students at the end of the semester.  We will use these records to analyze the effects of the program.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>What should I tell my students about this program?</h4>
            <p>It is important not to tell your students that the program is intended to help them (see below). Doing so could prevent the program from working. You can describe the program as a study about how students learn and what schools can do to make school a better place for them. Once you register, you will receive a short document describing how to best introduce the study to your students.</p>
            <h4>Why shouldn't I tell my students this program is meant to help them?</h4>
            <p>People often get defensive when they are told something is meant to help them. They may feel insulted or become unduly skeptical, and this can prevent them from internalizing the program's key messages.</p>
            <h4>What about privacy?</h4>
            <p>We will always respect your privacy and your students' privacy. Our programs are approved by the Stanford University Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. Sensitive data are collected and stored securely, and they are only shared in de-identified or aggregate form with individuals outside the PERTS research team.</p>
