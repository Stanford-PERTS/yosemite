	<h3>Requirements for Schools</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Enroll at least 100 students who will participate. Some programs require more.</li>
        <li>Designate a school administrator or faculty member to act as the PERTS Coordinator. This person will be our point of contact throughout your school's participation.</li>
        <li>The PERTS Coordinator will also provide us with the academic records of participating students at the end of the semester. We will use these records to analyze the effects of the program. Once the analysis is complete, we will send participating teachers and administrators a report summarizing the results.</li>
      </ol>
    
    <h3>Requirements for Teachers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Teachers use a simple, online form to schedule when their classes will participate in the program. This process takes 5-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the scheduled times, teachers take their students to the school computer lab. Instructions for each program session are provided to teachers when they schedule participation. Participation takes 45 minutes per session.</li>
      </ol>
