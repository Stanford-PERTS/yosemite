            PERTS programs draw on decases of research on motivation to help students learn to think about school in different ways. The goal is to help students come to think about learning and school in ways that help them stay motivated and resilient. 
            Our programs are designed by behavioral scientists at leading research institutions and evaluated using rigorous, randomized controlled studies.

    <h3>How do PERTS programs work?</h3>
        <p>
            To be successful, students must choose to learn and to persist even when schoolwork is challenging. Students' academic mindsets&mdash;their beliefs about learning and about school&mdash;affect these choices. PERTS interventions target these mindsets to improve students' outcomes.
